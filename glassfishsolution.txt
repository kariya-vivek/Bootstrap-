Got it! You want a **one-time setup** that makes GlassFish work smoothly with **NetBeans 8.x** for **all future projects**, even after restarting your computer. Let’s lock this down permanently 🔒

---

### 🛠️ Permanent Setup for GlassFish in NetBeans 8.x

#### ✅ Step 1: Fix Port Conflicts Once and For All
GlassFish uses port `8080`. If another app (like Oracle XE, Skype, or WAMP) uses it, GlassFish won’t start.

**Do this once:**
1. Go to:
   ```
   C:\GlassFish_Server\glassfish\domains\domain1\config
   ```
2. Open `domain.xml` in Notepad.
3. Find this line:
   ```xml
   <network-listener port="8080" protocol="http-listener-1" ... />
   ```
4. Change `8080` to something like `9090`:
   ```xml
   <network-listener port="9090" protocol="http-listener-1" ... />
   ```
5. Save the file.

✅ Now GlassFish will always use port `9090`, avoiding future conflicts—even after reboot.

#### ✅ Step 2: Disable Derby Server (Optional but Recommended)
Derby can cause startup issues.

1. Open NetBeans.
2. Go to **Services** → **Servers**.
3. Right-click **GlassFish Server** → **Properties**.
4. Uncheck **Start Registered Derby Server**.

✅ This prevents Derby from interfering with GlassFish.

---

#### ✅ Step 3: Run NetBeans as Administrator (Always)
1. Right-click the NetBeans shortcut.
2. Click **Properties** → **Compatibility** tab.
3. Check **Run this program as administrator**.
4. Click **Apply**.

✅ NetBeans will always have permission to control GlassFish.

---

#### ✅ Step 4: Set GlassFish as Default Server
1. In NetBeans, go to **Tools** → **Servers**.
2. Make sure **GlassFish Server** is listed and configured.
3. Set it as the default server.

✅ Every new project will automatically use GlassFish.

---

#### ✅ Step 5: Add GlassFish to System Startup (Optional)
If you want GlassFish to start with Windows:

1. Create a `.bat` file with this content:
   ```bat
   "C:\GlassFish_Server\bin\asadmin.bat" start-domain
   ```
2. Place it in:
   ```
   C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
   ```

✅ GlassFish will start automatically when your computer boots.

---

### 🎯 Final Result
- No more port errors ✅  
- No need to reconfigure after reboot ✅  
- Works for **every project** ✅  
- NetBeans always ready to deploy ✅  

If you want, I can help you test this setup with a sample project to confirm everything’s working perfectly. Want to give it a spin? 🌀
